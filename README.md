## [enum test](https://github.com/npes87184/Exercise/tree/master/c_cpp/enum_test)

This example shows how to test enum list in compile time. It will compile error, if the enum list is not synced with look up table. You can add look up table in anywhere you want to use the enum list to ensure if someone adds a new entry of enum, he(she) should check the code which uses this enum.
